# ARKTIK Accountability Initiative: Restoring Trust and American Values

## Overview

Welcome to the ARKTIK Accountability Initiative, a movement rooted in faith, perseverance, and a steadfast commitment to bringing back integrity to American life. This repository documents the journey of a disabled veteran with ALS and PTSD who, through resilience and unwavering faith, built a nonprofit dedicated to uplifting families, creating jobs for disabled individuals, and restoring community strength. When unethical practices threatened these efforts, this initiative became a mission to fight back—not just for personal justice but for the American values of accountability, family, security, and honoring promises.

This is more than one person’s story. It’s a call to action for every American who believes in hard work, faith, and standing up for what is right.

- **Financial Misguidance:** Harmful advice leading to unjust repossessions.

These practices harm families, threaten dreams, and undermine the core values of fairness and trust. Companies involved include AutoNation USA Houston, BMW North of Houston, and American Credit Acceptance (ACA). For more, see the [Public Case Summary Document](./PUBLIC_CASE_SUMMARY.md).
